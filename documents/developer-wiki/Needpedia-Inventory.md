NEEDPEDIA INVENTORY

Every system, account and piece of code that makes up Needpedia: what it
is, what it does, where its code lives, what it runs on, and where its
rebuild instructions are. Part of the project seed: a public package
anyone can unpack, with an AI's help, to run their own independent
version of all of this.

Edition 4, 1 October 2026. Written by the JOHN thread with Tony Brasher.
New in edition 4: Needpedia's money links (section 11) and what to
replace in the assistants' knowledge bases (section 15).
Canonical copies:

Public. No passwords, keys or private contact details are in here, and
none ever go in. Handing over Needpedia's own accounts is a separate job.

Each entry has some of these:
- What it does
- Code: where the code lives
- Runs on: what keeps it running
- Needs: accounts a new person would make for their own version
- Rebuild instructions: where they are, or "not written yet"
- Status


## 1. needpedia.org, the main site

- What it does: a civic collaboration site. People post a Subject, the
  Problems within it and Ideas to solve them, and work on them together
  with groups, task cards, note/question/debate tokens, ratings and a
  time bank.
- Every feature, what it does and whether it works:
  https://nexus.needpedia.org/needpedia-capabilities.txt
- Where each feature lives in the code:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Queuevius/Needpedia/Needpedia-Repo-Map.md
- Code: https://github.com/Queuevius/Needpedia
- Runs on: a rented server at Amazon Web Services. Built with Ruby on
  Rails (a framework for websites), a PostgreSQL database, and a
  background worker for slow jobs.
- Needs: a server, a domain name, an email-sending service (for
  account confirmations and password resets), a Mapbox account (the
  map on location posts), an AI account (see section 9).
- Not in the code: some content lives only in the site's database and
  is entered through the admin pages: the assistants' instructions,
  email templates, how-tos, FAQs, page pop-up guides, homepage
  messages. A new empty site starts without them. Export: not done yet.
- Rebuild instructions: not written yet. The test-site package (section
  6) builds the whole site from scratch and is the closest thing.
- Status: live. Built almost entirely by Murtaza, the lead developer.
- The site's own code calls no AI service. Lotte and Florence (sections
  2 and 3) do the AI work and use the site's public API to read and
  make posts.
- Unchecked: the code names Mailjet as its email-sending service; the
  live site has also used Mailgun. Which one the live site uses now.

Needpedia's three AI assistants, Florence, Lotte and Adele, are named
after librarians who resisted fascism.

## 2. Florence, the greeter

- What it does: the AI assistant that greets visitors who are not
  logged in, answers questions and helps them decide whether to join.
- Code: https://github.com/Queuevius/needpedia-greeter-production
- Runs on: Vercel (a website hosting service), from Tony's account.
  Live at https://needpedia-greeter-production.vercel.app
- Needs: a Vercel account (or other hosting), an OpenRouter account.
- AI: OpenRouter, checked in the code 1 October 2026. It uses OpenAI's
  free software toolkit pointed at OpenRouter's address with an
  OpenRouter key, so it needs no OpenAI account.
- To switch her to another AI service: change three settings, the
  service's address (OPENROUTER_BASE_URL), its key (OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
  and the model (OPENROUTER_MODEL). No code change.
- Her project's front page (README) lists every setting she reads and
  what it does. Rewritten 1 October 2026 to match the code.
- Rebuild instructions: not written yet.
- Status: live. Last updated 20 August 2026, when conversation saving
  was added.
- Unchecked: how needpedia.org reaches it; the Needpedia code never
  names its address.

## 3. Lotte, the main assistant

- What it does: the AI assistant for logged-in users. Finds, creates
  and edits posts for them, in many languages.
- Code: https://github.com/Queuevius/needpedia-assistant-production
- Runs on: Vercel, from Tony's account.
  Live at https://needpedia-assistant-production.vercel.app
- Needs: a Vercel account (or other hosting), an OpenRouter account.
- AI: OpenRouter, checked in the code 1 October 2026, with a setting
  for a full model and one for a cheaper "eco" model. No OpenAI account
  needed.
- To switch her to another AI service: her service's address is written
  into her code, in app/api/chat/route.ts
  (baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1'). Change that one line, then
  her key (OPENROUTER_API_KEY) and model settings.
- Rebuild instructions: not written yet.
- Status: live. Last updated 20 August 2026.
- Unchecked: same as Florence.

## 4. Adele and the public email page (Public Coms)

- What it does: a public web page showing the mail of the volunteer
  coordination address, VC@Needpedia.org, with the AI assistant Adele
  working in it. Public on purpose, so anyone can see what volunteers
  and leaders are doing. New senders' mail stays private until they
  agree to it being shown.
- Code: https://github.com/Queuevius/vc-email
- Runs on: Vercel, from Tony's account.
  Live at https://vc-email-five.vercel.app/inbox
- Needs: a Vercel account (or other hosting), an email mailbox the page
  can sign in to, an AI account.
- Rebuild instructions: not written yet.
- Status: live.

## 5. The phone notification app

- What it does: tells people on their phones when there is activity
  they care about, so they come back, collaborate and build
  communities. The site side already sends alerts for private messages
  and edits to tracked posts.
- Code: https://github.com/Queuevius/Needpedia-phone-app
- Runs on: people's phones, plus a Google notification project that
  delivers the alerts.
- Needs: a Google account with its own notification project.
- Rebuild instructions: not written yet.
- Status: not published yet.

## 6. The test sites

- What it does: runs several separate copies of Needpedia on one
  machine, each at its own web address, so volunteers can show work in
  progress before it goes to the lead developer for review.
- Code: https://github.com/Queuevius/needpedia-test-sites
- Runs on: any Linux computer with Docker and at least 4 GB of memory.
  One idle copy uses about 490 MB.
- Rebuild instructions:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Queuevius/Needpedia/Needpedia-Test-Site-Package.md
- Status: working, tested 30 September 2026. Built by John Sunday.

## 7. The Nexus

- What it does: Needpedia's own document server, at
  https://nexus.needpedia.org. Holds the reference articles, the
  botskill posts (behaviour guides for AI assistants), the AI studios
  where volunteers work with an assistant, an activity page watching
  needpedia.org, and an admin chat.
- Code: on Tony's desktop computer only. Not online yet. Keys must be
  taken out before it goes online.
- Runs on: an ordinary Linux desktop. A web server in Docker, a small
  Python program for admin features, and Cloudflare Tunnel, which makes
  a home computer reachable at a web address.
- Needs: a computer that stays on, a domain name, a Cloudflare account,
  an AI account.
- Rebuild instructions: not written yet.
- Status: live.

## 8. The thread system

- What it does: a way of working with many AI chats at once, one per
  project ("threads"). Each thread keeps a public prompt accomplice
  (its standing facts and rules) and public posts where other threads
  leave it news, all run by one small script.
- How it works, in full:
  https://nexus.needpedia.org/working-with-tony.html
- Code: public copies of the two scripts:
  https://nexus.needpedia.org/botcouncil/threads-script.txt
  https://nexus.needpedia.org/botcouncil/make-tony-page-script.txt
- Runs on: any computer with Python, publishing to a web folder.
- In the seed: one thread for each part of the system, plus one for the
  person's own ideal workflow. Tony's note: for him it turned out more
  practical to work on his workflow as he used the other threads.
  Still, you never know.
- Rebuild instructions: a general starter kit is planned (offered to
  John as a job, 30 September 2026).
- Optional add-on, the Chrome capture extension: saves Claude
  conversations into the Nexus sidebar. Code on Tony's desktop only.

## 9. AI

- All of Needpedia's AI goes through OpenRouter, one account that
  reaches many AI models. Checked in Florence's and Lotte's code on
  1 October 2026.
- Recommended model: DeepSeek V4 v0813. Very cheap, and it can run on
  European servers that protect user data.
- You can use a different AI setup. Any AI service that accepts the
  same kind of messages works: another provider, a model's own maker,
  or a model running on your own computer. Florence switches by
  changing settings; Lotte by changing one line of code (sections 2
  and 3). Leaving OpenRouter out this way has not been tried yet.

Knowledge bases (KBs): each assistant's instructions and background
knowledge, written in plain language. They are not in the assistants'
code.
- Florence and Lotte: stored in needpedia.org's database, written and
  saved in versions on the master admin page "Ai Prompts" (proposed new
  name "AI KBs"). Each time someone talks to her, Florence asks the site
  for the version that is switched on, at
  /api/v1/ai_prompt?ai_type=Florence&token=(the prompt token).
- Adele: her main instruction sheet is stored in Upstash (an online
  storage service the email page uses) and edited on the email page's
  "Update KB" page, logged in as admin. A short set of built-in
  instructions also sits in her code (src/lib/ai.ts).
- In the seed: copies of all three, version 2.2, dated 24 and 25 July
  2026, taken from Tony's saved files. The live versions may have been
  changed since then.

## 10. Domain names

- needpedia.org and nexus.needpedia.org. Needpedia's are registered
  with IONOS, with their address records at Cloudflare.
- A new person chooses their own.

## 12. Documents copied into the seed

Copied in as files, not links, so an AI unpacking the seed can read
them even if these addresses stop working. Also copied in: the three
assistants' knowledge bases (section 9).
- The reference articles: https://nexus.needpedia.org/articles/index.txt
- The botskill posts: https://nexus.needpedia.org/botskills/index.txt
- The glossary: https://nexus.needpedia.org/articles/glossary.html
- Core facts: https://nexus.needpedia.org/articles/core-facts.html
- The capabilities file:
  https://nexus.needpedia.org/needpedia-capabilities.txt
- How to work with Tony and the thread system:
  https://nexus.needpedia.org/working-with-tony.html
- This inventory.

## 13. Old work

Whole systems no longer in use, kept so nothing is lost:
- https://github.com/Queuevius/Assistant : Needpedia's first AI
  assistant. Last changed March 2024. Not running anywhere.
- https://github.com/Queuevius/npdragonfly : the start of a radically
  transparent messaging system. It became the public email page
  (section 4).

## 14. Left out

- The Scrap-Yard projects and layout_fe: early work, used nowhere.
- The scheduler. We had to create our own scheduling app due to others
  not letting us schedule at any time. Needpedia's so international
  that wouldn't work. Its code was not kept. There are many scheduling
  apps to choose from, and an AI can build a custom one.

## 15. Making it your own

- Whoever sprouts the seed will have to edit their "about us" section
  too.
- The assistants' knowledge bases in the seed are Needpedia's, left as
  they are. They name Needpedia's Patreon, its fiscal sponsor's
  donation portal, and Needpedia's email addresses (Needpedia@gmail.com,
  VC@Needpedia.org). Put your own money links and contact addresses in
  your copies, or take them out.
- The contacts below are Needpedia's people, not yours.

## 16. Other copies of the seed

Others may have unpacked this seed and kept copies online. Look for
them before starting from scratch.
